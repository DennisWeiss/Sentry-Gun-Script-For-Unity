# Sentry-Gun-Script-For-Unity

Put the Sentry.cs script on the sentry. Drag the FPS Controller (or another gameobject representing the player) onto the player and target variable. Put the MoveObject.cs script somewhere (maybe in a script container). Put the PlayerHealth.cs script on the player. Put the Player tag on the FPS Controller (important). All the variables should be self-explanatory.
